				<h2>Welcome to Spotify-Match!</h2>
				<p>
					This is not a dating app, but it can bring people together.  
	
	The purpose of the app is to create communities based on similar musical tastes and exchange experiences between users.
	
	For everything to work, you will need to link your spotify account to the spotify-match, so that the application can gain access to your favorite artists, leaving those who do not have the same musical taste as you outside the list of potential friendships (matches).
	
	From these connections it will be possible to provide the user with an expansion of his musical horizons.
	The tool uses information given by users about their musical taste for profiles with similar tastes and thus suggests similar artists. You will be able to click indefinitely and be led by suggestions similar to those previously chosen in a huge reference search domino.</p>
